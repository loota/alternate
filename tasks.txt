1 Major Improve the heuristic. self:: and $this-> should not be needed to visually highlight
  Move more functionality to the backend, make file type specific configuration 
        
1 Major Make the heuristic find backwards. Cursor on X   if (1)X{   should find if. And in this situation  if ($this->foo())X{  it should find $this-> (or should it? Better make it configurable)

2 Minor Check for multibytes
        
2 Major Make complex structures configurable

2 Minor Gather a massive amount of test material, especially for if-switch alternations
        
3 Minor Check for no word under cursor error

3 Minor Checks for non-unique array keys
        
3 Major Make class visibility alternation add _ to the function or variable name
        
3 Major Refactor
        
3 Major if-to-switch breaks on nested if

3 Minor Create performance testing

4 Major Investigate the loop alternating

4 Minor Implement support for reading the standard input

5 Tweak Clean up the function call message on vim command from maps

********

Done 1 Create unit tests
Done 3 Tweak Where should the cursor move if after an alternation it would not be over the new word?  For example, cursor over d   word   -->   war  Should the cursor stay in the same position or move one character back?
Done 2 Minor Save the indentation when replacing complex structures
Done 3 Tweak Make sure the register a doesn't get clobbered on vim side
Done 3 Implement support for removal of groups from vim

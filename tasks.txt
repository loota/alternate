1 Major Improve the heuristic. self:: and $this-> should not be needed to visually highlight
        
1 Major Make the heuristic find backwards. Cursor on X   if (1)X{   should find if. And in this situation  if ($this->foo())X{  it should find $this->
        
1 Major Move more functionality to the backend
        
2 Minor Check for multibytes
        
2 Major Make complex structures configurable
        
2 Minor Save the indentation when replacing complex structures
        
3 Minor Check for no word under cursor error
        
3 Minor Checks for non-unique array keys
        
3 Major Make class visibility alternation add _ to the function or variable name
        
3 Major Refactor
        
4 Major Investigate the loop alternating



********

Done 1 Create unit tests
Done 3 Tweak Where should the cursor move if after an alternation it would not be over the new word?  For example, cursor over d   word   -->   war  Should the cursor stay in the same position or move one character back?
